  It seems Easter weekend is a great time to do revamps. In 2017 Easter weekend
  I revamped my web-profile. Today, just days to Easter; I've updated my blog on
  stanmd.tk

In 2017, I was hosting my 'static' web-profile on Wordpress. We could say that that was an overkill. What's more, was I still in the LAMP stack age while others thrived in Git-Based content using Jekyll etc.. like in [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/)?

"Wordpress never gets old!" is how I convince myself. With business thriving for theme creators in Envato, see [this](https://themeforest.net/) and [this](https://elements.envato.com/wordpress/themes), among other platforms, I bet a lot of guys agree with me. Plus it still serves for its purpose: providing an easy-to-use CMS that's widely supported by hosting companies; has a myriad of customizable themes and talent to do that for you.

Back to the chronicle, I bought stanmd.pro for the Wordpress-powered web-profile and [we were live](https://web.archive.org/web/20171126072325/http://stanmd.pro/)!! for more than at least one year, [It's still indexed by Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=stanmd.pro) 😅.
