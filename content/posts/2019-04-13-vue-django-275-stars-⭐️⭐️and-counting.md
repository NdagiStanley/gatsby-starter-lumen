275 stars and counting ...

On my home page: [stanmd.tk](stanmd.tk), one of the projects I have quoted to be working on is: [VueDjango](https://code.stanmd.tk/vue-django/), a full-featured Webpack setup of a VueJS 2.x app with hot-reload, lint-on-save, unit testing & css extraction integrated into a Django 2.x application.

We are now at 275 stars 🔥🔥

### Context

> Python is my main tool of trade as a Software/ Data Engineer. In a previous project, I challenged myself to use Django and VueJS hand-in-hand. It was a [photo-editing application](https://sjourney.herokuapp.com/)(Don't mind the missing image on the homepage, postimg.org seems to be down. I use [imgur](https://imgur.com) these days 😉) Here is its [codebase](https://github.com/NdagiStanley/symmetrical-journey). I had worked on another application with the same technical requirements: VueJS and Django: [not-by-might](http://nbm-doit.herokuapp.com/). The only difference between the two is that I used semantic UI on one and Bootstrap on another.

Back to vue-django. This project has three variations:
- Django 1.* - Vue 1.*
- Django 1.* - Vue 2.*
- Django 2.* - Vue 2.*

It's made such that by following [these steps](https://github.com/NdagiStanley/vue-django#usage-of-vuedjango), you have a project similar to what is hosted [here](https://vuedjango.herokuapp.com/) and you are ready to go.

### Community activity

Since this project was a fork from [vuejs-templates/webpack](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack) I decided to separate it so that I can track stars and forks. I looked forward to handling issues that are raised by people using this starterpack and it proved successful.

Since then the project has had:
- [275+ stars](https://github.com/NdagiStanley/vue-django/stargazers)
- [50+ forks](https://github.com/NdagiStanley/vue-django/network/members)
- [5 closed issues](https://github.com/NdagiStanley/vue-django/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug) (user created)
